# Ubuntu Dev Environment Installation and Setup

This project tracks its Python dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). As
such, to work on this project, the following steps are recommended in order to set up a Python
virtual environment.

This document assumes you are using an Ubuntu 20.04+ machine; though, it should be easy
enough to adapt the installation instructions for a different OS.

> **Note:** If you are not running Ubuntu 20.04+, then you will need to adapt the steps
> provided here (and in the Playbook) for your system.

## pyenv

It's recommended to use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage Python versions.

However, some build dependencies are required for pyenv to install versions of Python. On
Ubuntu 20.04+ systems, they can be installed as follows:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
```

```bash
$ sudo apt install --no-install-recommends make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
```

Install `git`:

```bash
$ sudo apt install git
```

Now clone the pyenv project using `git`:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
```

Run the following commands to add `pyenv` to your shell `$PATH`:

```bash
$ echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/shims:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Source your `~/.bashrc`, like so:

```bash
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

Install the version of Python tracked in [`.python-version`](../.python-version):

```bash
$ cat .python-version | pyenv install
```

Now switch to that Python version, like so:

```bash
$ eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```

## Poetry

This project has some dependencies that are installed via Poetry. The Poetry project provides
a custom installer for Linux; it can be run as follows:

```bash
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

To make the `poetry` executable available on your current shells `$PATH`, run:

```bash
$ source ~/.poetry/env
```

Poetry uses the [`pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml) and [`poetry.lock`](../poetry.lock)
files to track dependencies. Install the project dependencies, like so:

```bash
$ poetry install
```

### Two ways to use the Poetry environment

You can either spawn a new shell with the Python virtual environment instantiated, like so:

```bash
$ poetry shell
$ ansible-playbook main.yml
```

Or you can run commands ad-hoc style by prepending them with `poetry run`, as follows:

```bash
$ poetry run ansible-playbook main.yml
```

Now return to the original README for more instructions.
